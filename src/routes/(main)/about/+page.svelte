				This started as a single web page with smashed together code because I (eartharoid) wanted
				something pretty to put on my 7" Raspberry Pi touchscreen. The Christmas Countdown website
				now has thousands of visitors and the bot has been added to over 10,000 servers.

					The CountdownToXMAS (countdowntoxmas.tk) website was released. It featured copy-and-pasted

					The orginal Christmas Countdown Discord bot was released in November with the Santa hat

					Version 2 of the Discord bot was released, with not many new features, but "better" code.
					Version 2 of the website was developed but never released. The bot and website got a new

					In the first week of September development started on v3 of the Discord bot, which was

					translations and much needed timezone support for users and servers. Work on the new

					In early October, the Discord bot was rewritten for the third time. The v4 Discord bot was
					released in the week before Halloween, with Discord's slash commands, some new features
					(including Secret Santa, Santa Tracker, and jokes), and general user improvements. The new
					Svelte and TailwindCSS website was released less than 3 weeks later.
