# Enable the countdown

<Tip title="TL;DR">

**Use the [`/setup`](./commands#setup) command**:
`/setup countdown: webhook`, or
`/setup countdown: widget`

</Tip>

There are currently two types of countdown:

- [Webhook](#webhook-countdown): the original countdown, where a message is sent to the countdown channel every morning
- [Widget](#widget-countdown): where the name of a voice channel is updated every hour

Both countdowns can be used simultaneously.
You may want to set up both at the same time but <abbr title="/server set enabled: false auto_toggle: true">disable the countdown and set it to automatically toggle</abbr>.
If you do this, you'll have a widget all-year round, and the more prominent webhook will only be enabled between 1st-26th December.

## Webhook countdown

To enable the webhook countdown:

1. Create a new text channel in which @everyone can read but not write (e.g. "#countdown")
2. **Type `/setup countdown: webhook` in the new channel.**
    This will create a webhook *in the channel you use it in*.

The bot will keep sending messages to this channel until you use `/toggle`.
If you want it to stop automatically on th 26th December (and start again on the 1st December next year),
type `/server set auto_toggle: true`.

## Widget countdown

To enable the widget countdown, **type `/setup countdown: widget`.**
This will create a new (locked) voice channel at the top of your server's channel list.

<Info>

If the majority of your server members are from the same place,
you should **[change the server timezone](./timezones)**.
